  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Cybersecurity enthusiast and low-level software developer. I like to mess around with the low-level parts of a computer that either breaks it or makes something really cool. Sometimes I even take it upon myself to try and fix what i broke... <em>sometimes</em>.</p>

  <h2>Current Projects</h2>
  <p>You'll notice that some repositories have special names and others are named after what they are. If the repository holds a project that can run standalone then it will have a special name. If the repository holds a library or something similar then it will be named appropriately.</p>

  <strong>A lot of projects have either been taken down or made private due to them being an absolute mess, and me wanting to fix them before making them public again.</strong>
